Redmine Inline Note Images plugin
=======================

This plugin lets you preview images attached to issue notes.
By default redmine shows previews for the images attached in issue notes only in issue header.
If you have an issue with many notes and attachments it becames hard to navigate between notes and header and back again if you just want to see attached image.
This plugin will show image previews right inside a note.
