Line numbers Redmine plugin
===========================

Redmine plugin that enables line numbering in code blocks and adds a toggle button to turn it on/off.

- Installation: just clone it to your plugins directory and restart Redmine. No other steps needed.
- Configuration: on the plugin setting page, choose whether you want to show the line numbers and/or the toggle button.
- Compatibility: tested with Redmine 2.3, but I assume it works with older versions as well.
